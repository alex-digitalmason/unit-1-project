I then created an `if` statement checking to see if the current character and the next character are the same. If they are, a 1 is added to the count variable and if they are not then the count is added to the `new_string` variable and it moves on to the next letter. Once tha last character has been counted an `if` statement is used to check if the new string is longer than the original string and print whichever is shortest. "
